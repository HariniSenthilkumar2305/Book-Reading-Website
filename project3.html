        <H1><p>Life gives us chances, takes it and gives it again. Whether we are able to encash the opportunity, it all depends on us. I missed out many opportunities’ life offered to me. Ruskin Bond’s short story – Night Train at Deoli reminds me of the small moments of affection that I couldn’t dare to venture into.

           <p> Based on experiences of Ruskin Bond, the short story is story of two strangers who meet, separate and meet again. The two instances of affectionate meeting last for a lifetime for the narrator who craves to bond back with the girl he met at the station. Railway stations are meeting points to bond and part away. While going to his grandma’s house, the narrator’s train halts at Deoli, a small station 30 miles from Dehra. Unlike other stations, Deoli station doesn’t has any crowd. Except for stray dogs, tea stall and a station master, the Deoli is like a sleepy town cut down from human touch. The train halts at Deoli only for ten minutes. Neither anyone boards the train or gets down from it. It is here at the lonely station where the narrator meets a basket selling girl twice. He meets her twice during his trip to hometown. The two meetings make him fall in love with the village girl on Deoli station. Though he attempts to strike an emotional bond, he is unsuccessful because the train halts there only for 10 minutes. In the third meeting he gathers the courage to express his feelings to the basket selling girl at Deoli station. Unfortunately, the girl is nowhere to be seen at the station. He enquires about the girl at the station but fails to get any idea regarding her whereabouts. Dejectedly he boards the Deoli with a hope that he will meet the girl again. The short story ends on a sad note. Though the narrator passes through the Deoli station several times, he never dares to go beyond the Deoli station fearing that girl may be dead or have left the place forever. He is still clung to a false hope that he will meet the basket selling girl someday.
            
            Loosely based on events happened in life of author Ruskin Bond, ‘Night Train at Deoli’ is a classic, timeless short story with theme of romance, travel and nostalgia within it. It reminded me of Russian author Fyodor’s short story ‘White Nights’ where the lonely protagonist meets a young woman on a rainy night and falls in love instantly. The one side romance lasts for only four days when the young woman’s lover returns back. Even here the narrator in the short story has a faint hope that the girl will come back to station someday. Many of Ruskin Bond’s short stories are centered around rail journeys and station. The second popular short story of rail journey was ‘The Eyes Have It’ where two visually impaired strangers strike a bond during a short journey unaware that they both are blind. Actually, I relate to this short story ‘The Night Train at Deoli’ a lot with a false hope that the person will cross the path with me someday. Short stories have their own audience and readership. Among several short stories, ‘Night Train at Deoli’ really tugs your heart.</p>
